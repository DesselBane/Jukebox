\markboth{Acknowledgements}{Acknowledgements}

First of all I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Matthias Teßmann, and Klaus Raithel for their support in technical and editorial matters during the writing of this thesis. I am grateful to my mother, Andrea Schultheiß, who has provided me with moral support and helpful comments. I would also like to thank the rest of my family and friends including my cat who have cheered me up along the way.
