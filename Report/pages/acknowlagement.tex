First of all I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Mathias Te√ümann and the faculty staff for their support during the writing of this thesis. I am grateful to my mother Andrea, who has provided me with moral support and accurate comments which were of critical importance, during this work. I am also grateful to my other family members and friends who have supported me along the way.
