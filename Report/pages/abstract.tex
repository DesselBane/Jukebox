The purpose of this work is to explain how the Electron, Angular, and ASP.NET Core frameworks can be used to create a cross-platform application with a single code base. A brief introduction is given on the proof-of-concept application and its architecture. Each framework is described in general, followed by a section about the challenges presented by development and possible solutions. These are illustrated by detailed examples of the code written for the proof-of-concept application. The implementation of notifications, creation of a system tray icon, and websocket communication are addressed in detail. The adaptability and ease of use of these three frameworks is analyzed and compared to the advantages and disadvantages presented by a pure desktop or a pure web application.
